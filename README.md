# MonNet

MonNet is a hybrid of a homepage accessible from your web browser and a preview/summary of your network, featuring additional options.

</p>

## MonNet Status

MonNet is currently in an early version. It is possible that issues may arise between versions. The compatibility is not guaranteed.

The English language (EN/US) is AI generated.

I started implementing Ansible as a replacement for phpseclib as a method to connect to and retrieve data from hosts.

# Features

    - Track Host In your network and have and inventory
    - Alarms/Events (Agent)
    - A simple bookmarks dashboard
    - Basic IPAM
    - Basic Hosts Stats (Agent)
    - Linux Support (Ansible/Agent)
    - Host Notes
    - Get Host Logs (Ansible)
    - Email Alerts

    Partially working Features

    - Execute Playbooks (Ansible)
    - Respond to events in hosts with playbooks ((Agent/Ansible)

    Future Features:

    - Windows hosts support


## Versions Convention

v0.0.0 Mayor.Minor.Revision

Mayor/Minor implies database changes or other code mayor changes.

Revision version implied only code changes, never database changes.

## LICENSE

CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

# MonNet Install

The fast method is using the docker-compose.yml

Here the manual process

## Deps

LAMP
    Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP
    Tested: Debian 12, Apache2, PHP8.2, Mariadb 10

    That mean in Debian:
    apt install apache2 php-fpm php-mysqli php-curl php-mbstring

Python
    Tested with >3

Mysql/MariaDB:
    You can install or use a remote machine with mysql

arp
    Optional for get mac's address, only work same network (other method will added in the future)

```
    apt install net-tools
```

## Initial database settings

```
mysql -u root -p
mysql> CREATE DATABASE monnet;
mysql> CREATE USER 'monnet'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON monnet.* TO 'monnet'@'localhost'
```

## Clone repo

```
/var/www/html# git clone https://github.com/diegargon/monnet .
/var/www/html# chown -R www-data:www-data *
/var/www/html# chmod 755 cache logs
```

Ansible support with the agent

```
git clone https://github.com/diegargon/monnet-ansible /opt/monnet-ansible
```

## Config

Check config/config.defaults.php and add  the keywords you want to change
to /etc/monnet/config.inc.php.

it’s better not copy the files just add the keywords you want change

Do not rename or modify config.defaults.php directly, as it will be overwritten.

These are the main config keywords you must check/change and copy to the /etc file.

Warning: path config must included even if the default is valid

Mandatory

```
$cfg_db['dbhost']
$cfg_db['dbname']
$cfg_db['dbuser']
$cfg_db['dbpassword']
$cfg['path'] = '/var/www/html';
```

Optional

```
$cfg['rel_path'] = '/';
$cfg['lang'] = 'es';
```

## Setting the database

```
/var/www/html# mysql monnet < config/monnet.sql -p
```

## Default frontend user : pwd

```
monnet : monnetadmin
```

## Setting crontab

Times depends of the size of your network. Paths depends of your system

Here the config for run every 5 and 15 minutes each task

```
$ nano /etc/crontab
*/5 * * * * root /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/monnet-cli.php
*/15 * * * * root /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/monnet-discovery.php
```

In the future we will migrating that cli tools to python.

## Composer

Necessary if you want support for send mails

```
apt install composer

/path/to/monnet# composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

## Monne Agent

I am testing a basic linux agent (python based) for reports.
The agent is the  monnet-ansbile repo/sources and has his own
playbook to automatically install if you want.

You can install it manually check the install-agent-linux playbook for steps

Python: Automatic process will install on the hosts: psutils

## Ansible Support

Ansible support its a testing feature, it will help to install the agent and in
the future, crate and doing other common "ansible tasks"

# Install ansible

```
apt install ansible
```

# Install monnet-ansible

```
git clone https://github.com/diegargon/monnet-ansible.git
```


## Ansible server

Ansible server listen in localhost only, it is a testing feature without security.
You must install ansible in the same system.

Ansible must output in json format.

```
nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

[defaults]
stdout_callback=json
```



## Ansible client hosts

By default the ansible ssh user will be 'ansible'

Must be/have:

    * sudo member without need type password
    * have the public ssh key installed

Example

```
apt install sudo
adduser --disabled-password ansible
usermod -aG sudo ansible
```

Start 'visudo' and add:

```
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

# Fedora

```
sudo adduser ansible
sudo usermod -aG wheel ansible
```

You must have checking the "Ansible Support" in General configuration tab and "Ansible Support" in the host configuration
section (Web UI)

## SSH CERTS

For Ansible server to connect to the hosts, you need to generate an SSH key and install it on each host you want to access via Monnet/Ansible.

```
$ ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ansible@ip.ip.ip.ip
```
The user must exists and must be allowed log with standard credentials to install de key (you can disable it after)


Or do it manually

On the client host:

```
runuser -u ansible mkdir /home/ansible/.ssh
runuser -u ansible nano /home/ansible/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

and paste the ssh pub key

If you don't use ssh-copy-id you must add manually the known_host (Monnet server side)

```
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa,ed25519 -H server.example.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts 2>&1
```

If the host fingerprint change you must remove first the old one

```
ssh-keygen -R
```

You can force ansible to ignore the host fingerprint check

```
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```

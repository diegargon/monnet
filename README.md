# MonNet

MonNet is a hybrid of a homepage accessible from your web browser and a preview/summary of your network, featuring additional options.

</p>

## MonNet Status

MonNet is currently in an early version. It is possible that issues may arise between versions. The compatibility is not guaranteed.

The English language (EN/US) is AI generated.

I started implementing Ansible as a replacement for phpseclib as a method to connect to and retrieve data from hosts.

## Versions Convention

v0.0.0 Mayor.Minor.Revision

Mayor/Minor implies database changes or other code mayor changes
Revision version implied only code changes, never database changes.

## LICENSE

CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

Resume:

# MonNet Install

## Deps

LAMP
    Linux, Apache, Mysql, PHP
    Tested: Debian 12, Apache2, PHP8.2, Mariadb 10

    That mean in Debian:
    apt install apache2 php-fpm php-mysqli php-curl php-mbstring

Mysql/MariaDB:
    You can install or use a remote machine

arp
    Optional for get mac's address, only work same network (other method will added in the future)

```
    apt install net-tools
```

## Initial database settings
```
mysql -u root -p
mysql> CREATE DATABASE monnet;
mysql> CREATE USER 'monnet'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON monnet.* TO 'monnet'@'localhost'
```

## Clone repo
```
/var/www/html# git clone https://github.com/diegargon/monnet .

/var/www/html# chown -R www-data:www-data *
/var/www/html# chmod 755 cache logs
```

## Config

Check config/config.defaults.php and add the keywords you want to change to /etc/monnet/config.inc.php.

If you copy the file, itâ€™s better to remove all unchanged config entries.

Do not rename or modify config.defaults.php directly, as it will be overwritten.

These are the main config keywords you must check/change and copy to the /etc file.

```
$cfg_db['dbhost']
$cfg_db['dbname']
$cfg_db['dbuser']
$cfg_db['dbpassword']
$cfg['path'] = '/var/www/html';
$cfg['rel_path'] = '/';
$cfg['lang'] = 'es';
```

## Setting the database

```
/var/www/html# mysql monnet < config/monnet.sql -p
```

## Default frontend user : pwd

```
monnet : monnetadmin
```

## Setting crontab

Times depends of the size of your network. Paths depends of your system

Here the config for run every 5 and 15 minutes each task

```
$ nano /etc/crontab
*/5 * * * * root /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/monnet-cli.php
*/15 * * * * root /usr/bin/php /var/www/html/monnet-discovery.php
```

## Composer

Necessary if you want support for send mail

```
apt install composer

/path/to/monnet# composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

## Monne Agent

Testing a basic linux agent (python based) for reports. Shipping with monnet-ansbile
repo/sources and his own playbook to install.

You can install it manually check the install-agent-linux playbook for steps

Python Extras: Automatic process will install: psutils

## Ansible Support

Ansible support its a testing feature, it will help to install the agent and in
the future, crate and doing other common "ansible tasks"

# Install ansible

```
apt install ansible
```

# Install monnet-ansible

```
git clone https://github.com/diegargon/monnet-ansible.git
```


## Ansible server

Ansible server listen in localhost only, it is a testing feature without security.
You must install ansible in the same Monnet system.

Ansible must output in json format.

```
nano /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

[defaults]
stdout_callback=json
```



## Ansible client hosts

By default the ansible ssh user will be 'ansible'

Must be/have:

    * sudo member without need type password
    * have the public ssh key installed

Example

```
apt install sudo
adduser --disabled-password ansible
usermod -aG sudo ansible
```
Start 'visudo' and add:

```
ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

# Fedora

```
sudo adduser ansible
sudo usermod -aG wheel ansible
```

You must have checking the "Ansible Support" in General configuration tab and "Ansible Support" in the host configuration
section (Web UI)

## SSH CERTS

For Ansible server to connect to the hosts, you need to generate an SSH key and install it on each host you want to access via Monnet/Ansible.
```
$ ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@ip.ip.ip.ip
```

Or do it manually

On the client host:

```
runuser -u ansible mkdir /home/ansible/.ssh
runuser -u ansible nano /home/ansible/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
and paste the ssh pub key

If you don't use ssh-copy-id you must add manually the known_host (Monnet server side)

```
ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa,ed25519 -H server.example.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts 2>&1
```

If the host fingerprint change you must remove first the old one

```
ssh-keygen -R
```

You can force ansible to ignore the host fingerprint check

```
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```
